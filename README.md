Topic:  Get positive, neutral, or negative feedback for articles of a topic from News sources

Make  a program where it takes a topic of interest and a time frame 
- Run this through the multiple News’s APIs
-Determine if that topic is positive,negative, or neutral for each News source
-Compare the results with all the News sources(to see if there is any bias)
-Give the result based on the comparison

Responsibilities:
Once we break up General Tasks for our Project, We can assign them equally .
Check in with each other to check if our task is “okay” with each other and ask for help when needed.
Everyone should try to find some data once we are sure of our topic.

Team Leader: Elder

Roles:
Research api - Elder
Data Visualizations ie world heatmap, trend charts, ets - Bree
Pre processing, stop words - Seba
Ppt - Cole

I can do powerpoint if you guys need someone [Cole]
-Personally, I wouldn't want to be the main Power Point person [seba].
open to any tasks [bree]



Technologies we want to use:

Depending on Our topic, and purpose, we should try getting as much stuff we covered in class in our project.

NLP, to process any text coming in and create data / summaries based on it
Data Science / Stats to calculate scores and probabilities
